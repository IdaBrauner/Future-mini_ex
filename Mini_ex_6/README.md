My 3 rules in this program turned out to be fairly simple. In the beginning I wanted to create generative art inspired by a caleidoscope. However, it did not take long for me to realize, that I do not yet posses advanced enough skills to create such a thing. So my 3 rules was:
1. The ellipses must appear at different locations each time you run the program.
2. The ellipses will appear in different colors.
3. Something will have an impact on the ellipses color.

As you can see, 3 simple rules. 
My program generates ellipses in random places and in different colors, which has a degree of randomness in them.
I wanted to make an array of different colors, so the colors would not be completely random, but rather choose randomly between already predefined colors by me. Because I did not figure out how to make an array of specific colors, I chose to decide 3 main colors, that would vary a bit in shade.

This task caused me a lot of frustration, since I had a lot of ideas, but also a lot of trouble while making it. However, it has helped me to get a better understanding of generativity and how it is possible to make. At first you might think it is necesarry to create a complicated and long code, but if you don't wish to make that much happen on the screen, it can be very simple as well. It was a frustrating, yet interesting task to work with generativity, and I definitely think, that the more comfortable you are with coding, the more fun you will have with generativity.
