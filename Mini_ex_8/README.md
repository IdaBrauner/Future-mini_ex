Notice that the link does not work as it should - probably because Github is not able to access the open weather API that we used. The first screenshot shows the program when it is working; here we see Moscow, Copenhagen and Paris having a temperature between 10-20 degrees celsius, and London having between 0-10 degrees celsius.

I am collaborating with Sara. Our program is called "Cheers".

The program uses the open weather API which is also incorporated in an example by Daniel Shiffman (one of the videos we watched for this week). 

We used the weather data from 4 different cities, and chose to show the temperature. 
The temperature is shown through the amount of beverages in the glasses - The level of the beverages 
We have used an if-statement to determine how full the glasses should be, according to the temperatures in concern - a high temperature equals a fuller glass while a low temperature equals a glass that is not so full. We have chosen to set the lowest temperature to less than -10 celcius, and the highest temperature to more than 20 celcius. Then we have divided it into 5 levels, so each level consists of 10 celcius. To make it more precise, we could have chosen to create more levels. 

At first it did seem a bit confusing with the API's and trying to understand how it was all connected and how i works, but after a while and after trying out different things, it all made more sense. I think it had a very positive influence on my learning that neither me or Sara is that familiar with coding. This forced us to figure out almost all of the thing ourselves, instead of just asking someone who has more experience in coding. 


Even though I am getting more and more familiar with API's and the provided data, I still feel like there are some blank spaces. 

Another difficult thing, is actually getting the API. You casn have a lot of ideas on what you would like to make, but the API can be an obstacle in itself, since they are not always available.

A question I could ask myself in getting more familiar with the API might be a quite big one, however it would clear out some things for me. Can you create a visual representation on how the API works with your own program?
