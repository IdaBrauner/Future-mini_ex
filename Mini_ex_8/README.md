What is the program about? which API have you used and why?
The program uses the open weather API which is also incorporated in an example by Daniel Shiffman (one of the videos we watched for this week). 

We used the weather data from 4 different cities, and chose to show the temperature. 
The temperature is shown through the amount of beverages in the glasses - The level of the beverages 
We have used an if-statement to determine how full the glasses should be, according to the temperatures in concern - a high temperature equals a fuller glass while a low temperature equals a glass that is not so full. We have chosen to set the lowest temperature to less than -10 celcius, and the highest temperature to more than 20 celcius. Then we have divided it into 5 levels, so each level consists of 10 celcius. To make it more precise, we could have chosen to create more levels. 

(individual)Can you describe and reflect your process of making this mini exercise in terms of acquiring, processing, 
using and representing data? How much do you understand 
this provided data? How do platform providers sort the data and give you the selected data?
(individual)Try to formulate a question in relation to web APIs or querying processes that you want to investigate further when you have more time.
