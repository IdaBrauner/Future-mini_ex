For mini_ex_7 I have worked together with Trine Lind Elming. 

For this exercise we were asked "To design and implement an electronic literature that utilizes written text/audio text as the main medium". 
We chose to use text as our main medium. More specifically we chose poetry, since it has been one of the main subjects when we have been discussing language plus code. 
Our program consists of 2 poems by the author Tove Ditlevsen, and a black and white picture of her in the background. We chose this picture, because it is a classic picture of Ditlevsen with the black and white and a smoke in her hand. 
Furthermore, the 2 poems are called "Blinkende lygter"(flickering lights) and "Sovende Pige"(Sleeping girl). Both of the poems have the same lenght in lines(24), which was crucial to suceed with our plans for the program. 

The program is fairly simple, the 2 poems starts out with 2 seperate poems, and when the mouse is pressed, every second line of each poem will shift position with every second line of the other poem. Then when the mouse is pressed again, they shift back into their original position. 
We chose the color yellow for the text, because it made the text pop becuase it is such a huge contrast to the black and white background. 

We had also thought about making it possible for the user to choose which lines to swift position, or to first make it every second line, then every third line, then every fourth line and so on, however we thought it was a good idea to keep it simple.

I have added a picture of the code with comments, since I had already uploaded the file without comments and didn't know how to change it. So the picture below is the code with some explenations.

The text "Vocable code" evolves a lot around the poetry in code, and focuses alot on the code itself. In our mini_ex_7 we did not focus on the code, but rather on the outcome. I believe that it could have been possible for us to create the same outcome, but with perhaps a more poetic code. We could have changed some of the variables names, so the would've been some sort of coherence in them, which could have created a meaning when put together. 

We did however think of how language/ poetry and code is different. Our idea was, that even though some of the lines in the poems changed position, it would still make sense in some way. Even though poems have to follow some rules in terms of rythm, length and perhaps rhyme, it is still different from writing a message or essay to someone. The lines doesn't have to be "complete", and they don't necessarily need to have a verb or a subjectiv to create meaning. So even though some of the lines changed position, the poems still made sense. 
However, if you look at coding, it will hardly work if you change some of the lines in one code with another. The program won't be able to run.
